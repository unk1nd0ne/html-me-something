                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Early January 2020, I spent two weeks working in Singapore. One of the big attractions I visisted was a garden destination at the Marina Bay called <a href="https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/">Gardens by the Bay</a>. At night, they light up the park in a dazzling array of colors which transforms the park into a surreal landscape.</p>

                    <h2>Supertrees</h2>
                    <p>The Supertrees are giant tree shaped garden strctures. At night, lit up, they give the feeling of walking through an alien world.</p>

                    <h2>Dragonfly Lake</h2>
                    <p>Dragonfly Lake is a thin lake with a wooden walkway that encircles the shore. Throughout the lake there are dragonfly sculptures and large rubbery egg shaped things. At night, the eggs are lit up with shifting colors and delcate music is played in the background.</p>

                    <h2>Giant Baby</h2>
                    <p>If you walk the entirety of the drgonfly lake path, there is a short diversion at one end where you have to leave the lake briefly before circling back. Right in the middle of this, you'll get to see a good example of some of the parks various scupltures. Whether this enhances or spoils the mood, I'll let you decide.</p>
