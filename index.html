                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I was lucky enough to spend the first two week of January 2020 working in Singapore. Being that I was working pretty hard, I did not get to see as much as I would have liked but I was able to visit one of the big attractions a "garden destination" at the Marina Bay called <a href="https://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/">Gardens by the Bay</a>. It was rougly five miles from my hotel and I ended up making the trek twice, once during the day and once at night. My night visit was, by far, the more interesting because they light up the park in a dazzling array of colors which transforms the lush landscape into a surreal and almost otherworldly experience.</p>

                    <h2>Supertrees</h2>
                    <p>The Supertrees are giant tree shaped garden strctures. During the day, they stand majestically, covered in vegetation and providing shade and relief from the sun. There is a suspened walkway that you can purchase access to which gives an amazing view of structures as well as the reast of the Gardens. At night, lit up, they give the feeling of walking through an alien world.</p>

                    <h2>Dragonfly Lake</h2>
                    <p>Dragonfly Lake is a thin lake with a wooden walkway that encircles the shore. Throughout the lake there are dragonfly sculptures, fountains, and large rubbery egg shaped things. During the day, it is a resful walk with a slight misting from the fountains to cool you and benches to take a break if you need. At night, the eggs are lit up with shifting colors and delcate music is played in the background. You'll see couples walking hand in hand or lounging beside the path. At the far end of the attaraction (away from Mariana Bay) the walk way diverts from the shoreline inland, in order to circle around to a bridge to the other side.</p>

                    <p>Right in the middle of this diversion, you'll get to see a good example of some of the parks various scupltures. Whether this enhances or spoils the mood, I'll let you decide.</p>
